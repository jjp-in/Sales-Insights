# Sales-Insights
This project uses data analysis to generate sales insights for a company that sells computer peripherals. It shows how to collect, clean, and visualize sales data to help improve decision-making.
Project Title: Leveraging Data Analytics for Sales Insights
Introduction:
In this project, I aim to showcase my data analysis skills by developing a system to generate actionable sales insights. This project will be valuable for aspiring data analysts seeking to enhance their skillset in data collection, transformation, visualization, and communication.
Problem Statement:
Many companies in the sales industry, like this illustrative company specializing in computer peripherals, rely on manual data collection methods like phone calls. This approach has limitations:
Incompleteness: Phone calls might not capture all relevant sales data.
Inaccuracy: Manual data entry is prone to errors.
Limited Insights: It's difficult to identify trends and patterns from raw data.
Proposed Solution:
This project proposes implementing a data-driven approach to sales analysis. By hiring a data analyst, the company can:
Collect comprehensive sales data from various regions.
Clean, transform, and analyze the data to identify trends and patterns.
Develop interactive dashboards and reports for clear data visualization.
Benefits:
This approach will empower the marketing sales director with:
A holistic understanding of the business's performance.
Data-driven insights to identify areas for improvement and growth.
Ability to make informed decisions based on clear visualizations.
Data Analytics Process:
Data Collection and Storage:
The sales team gathers data and provides it to the IT team.
The IT team stores the data in an OLTP database for transactional purposes.
A separate data warehouse is used for data analytics to ensure data integrity.
Data Transformation:
Data engineers transform the data from the OLTP database to the data warehouse for analysis. This includes cleaning, aggregating, and structuring the data.
Project Scope: Data Visualization with Power BI
This project focuses on using Power BI to create visualizations from data extracted from an SQL database.
Data Access and Querying:
We will connect to the SQL database and query the data using SQL.
Basic SQL queries will be used to explore the data and extract insights.
Data Import and Transformation in Power BI:
We will import the data from SQL into Power BI.
Power Query will be used to clean, transform, and prepare the data for analysis.
Data Visualization:
Interactive dashboards and reports will be created in Power BI to provide insights into sales performance.
Implementation:
SQL Data Import and Querying:
We will import the relevant SQL tables into SQL Server.
Basic SQL queries will be used to:
Count records
Filter records based on specific criteria
Calculate total revenue
Select records within a date range
Join tables for comprehensive insights
Importing Data to Power BI:
Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) Process:
Extract: Connect to the SQL database and extract the data.
Transform: Clean and transform the data using Power Query.
Load: Load the transformed data into Power BI for analysis and visualization.
Data Connections and Schema Design:
Establish connections between relevant tables in Power BI.
Utilize a star schema for efficient data exploration (fact table with dimension tables).
Data Visualization:
Create interactive visualizations in Power BI to showcase sales insights.
Examples include total revenue, sales trends, top customers, etc.
Transforming Data Using Power Query:
We will perform the following transformations in Power Query:
Filter out empty rows and invalid sales values.
Cleanse specific data points, like currency conversion.
Remove duplicate entries.
Creating Visualizations in Power BI:
Build a comprehensive dashboard in Power BI with various visualizations:
Total revenue and sales figures.
Year-wise details for deeper analysis.
Identification of top-performing customers.
Revenue trendlines to visualize sales growth patterns.
Conclusion:
By implementing this data-driven approach, the company can leverage valuable sales insights to optimize its strategies and achieve significant business growth. This project demonstrates the power of data analytics in transforming raw data into actionable insights for informed decision-making.
This revised structure improves the flow of information and highlights the key steps involved in the project. It also clarifies the purpose of the project and its potential benefits.
